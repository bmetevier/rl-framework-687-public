    Apply the CEM algorithm to the More-Watery 687-Gridworld. Use a tabular 
    softmax policy. Search the space of hyperparameters for hyperparameters 
    that work well. Report how you searched the hyperparameters, 
    what hyperparameters you found worked best, and present a learning curve
    plot using these hyperparameters, as described in class. This plot may be 
    over any number of episodes, but should show convergence to a nearly 
    optimal policy. The plot should average over at least 500 trials and 
    should include standard error or standard deviation error bars. Say which 
    error bar variant you used.
